<!--
I had a lot of trouble with this one. I made it a lot more complicated than I needed to. 
I began with a grid framework from the link in Moodle. From there I began to over complicate it.
I was using a million diifferent sources once my first try with the framework didn't work how I expected. 
Now that I'm on the other side, I see I was originally very close, but I too a big wrong turn in th begining.
Although it took me a lot longer than I would have expected, I enjoyed being forced to play around with grids
and flex boxes. I made a ton of mistakes, but I can now say that I learned a lot about them.
